## Operator learning


- One major challenge of operator learning is how to represent a function, which is an infinite dimensional space. 
- **discretization invariant** operator learning is to learn a function that is invariant to the resolution of the input data.
- **Irregular mesh** operator learning is to learn a function that is invariant to the resolution of the input data, and also invariant to the mesh structure of the input data.
