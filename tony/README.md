## TODO
- Testing
  - hyper-parameters: neurons, activation, weights
  - manufactured solutions in 1D/2D/3D
- Implementation
  - adaptivity: learning rate, weights, collocation points
  - initialization: SIREN
  - analysis: sine series expansion for trainable part
  - other PDEs
  - 2D/3D Fourier coefficients
