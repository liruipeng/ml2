## TODO
- Testing
  - hyper-parameters: neurons, activation, weights
  - manufactured solutions in 2D/3D
- Implementation
  - architecture: boundary conditions and activation function with trigonometric functions
  - adaptivity: learning rate, weights, collocation points
  - initialization: SIREN
  - analysis: 2D/3D Fourier coefficients
