## TODO
- Testing
  - hyper-parameters: neurons, activation, weights
  - manufactured solutions in 2D/3D
- Implementation
  - adaptivity: learning rate (cyclic + reduced on plateau), weights (GradNorm), collocation points (frequency-targeted)
  - efficiency: precomputed Chebyshev inputs 
  - initialization: SIREN
  - analysis: 2D/3D Fourier coefficients
